                                <p>Companies are going to revolutionize the shopping experience and replace cash and credit cards with smartphones. People use smartphones to complete daily tasks including paying for goods and services. That’s why small businesses are encouraged to embrace mobile payments so that the customers can pay as easily as possible.  SnappyWire encompasses mobile wallets and mobile money transfers, both taking place through your mobile device.</p>
                                
                                <h3 class="project-number">What is SnappyWire?</h3>
                                <p>MySnappyPOS is a quick and simple payment app for small/individual merchants who want to be able to accept credit card payments and Apple Pay, using only a smartphone. By enabling payments without a traditional POS system or credit card terminals, MySnappyPOS turns your smartphone into a payment terminal. Small/individual merchants and sellers who install MySnappyPOS app can provide customers with a variety of payment experiences, as well as reduce costs. Working with Stripe also ensures customers that their payments are securely and accurately processed by its powerful payment processing system.</p>

It should only have a few features if need be, but anyone should be able to pick it up and use it without question. If a user can’t understand what they are using, the product has failed to ease the user’s frustrations.</li>
                                <li class="listText">2. Speed: The product should enable the user to achieve their goal quickly. Taking less time than competitors or current solutions is preferred as users don’t have much patience or usage for a slower product.</li>

                                <p>From talking with my colleagues and seeing the experience of current Fintech apps, it just made sense that Square was the clear solution for one reason: speed.

                                <p>I identified the key specs that had to be included in the app in order to build the MVP(minimum viable product), then mapped out user flows. At this point in the process, I found participatory design to be extremely helpful. I actually had end users mapping out their ideal flows, which I was then able to incorporate into my design.</p>

                                <p>Based on the user flows, I constructed the information architecture such that there was a minimal level of difficulty to immediately accessing relevant information. After all, the goal of this product is to enable users to quickly and easily sell items.</p>
